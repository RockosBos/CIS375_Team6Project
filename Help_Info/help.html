        <h4><center>This page is intended to help the user navigate the test case generator</center></h4>
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This Test case Generator is for a user looking to create test cases using a series of operations and Relationships between these operations.
            The original requirement was to create a web application that "Allows the User to enter all operations and their relationships from a behavioral model. 
            The tool then creates a set of test cases that exercise the relationships among operations." We developed the application to meet the following requirements.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>User can enter software operations and relationships and the application will generate test cases based on operations correctly calling one another</li>
            <li>Create an established help page that allows the user to understand the software. </li>
            <li>User can create as many operations and relatiosnships as they want.</li>
        </ol>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Add/Delete rows to get the desired number of operations.</p></li>
            <li>Type descriptions into each operation name.</p></li>
			<li>Add relationships to other operations using the operation ID. To add multiple, seperate them by spaces.</p></li>
			<li>Click the generate test cases button.</p></li>
			<li>Type PASS/FAIL in the results column to keep track of test case results.</p></li>
			<li>Go back and edit operations OR click the Reset Page button.</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Errors</h2>
        <h4 id="Warning">You have inserted an invalid relationship ID, they must be between 0 and the largest ID you have created, A relationship also cannot be the same ID and the Operation ID, see HELP for input instructions.</h4>
        <h4>Potential Fixes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Seperate relationships with spaces.</li>
            <li>Ensure that a relationship ID is not equal to the operation ID for a row (Operations cannot be a relationship with themselves)</li>
            <li>Make sure there is no leading or ending whitespace in the relationships box. </li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="Warning">You have inserted an invalid input, please enter a series of numbers separated by a space. See HELP for input instructions.</h4>
        <h4>Potential Fixes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Relationship Input's should be numbers seperated by spaces. This should be in the format (1 2 3 4) to have a relationship with the first 4 operations.</li>
            <li>There should not be non numeric characters in the relationships box. There should only be numbers.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4 id="Warning">All operations must have a name!</h4>
        <h4>Potential Fixes</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure you input a name into the Operation Name field.</li>
            
        </ol>
